# Car-Price-prediction

the data set used is from kaggel website

the aim of the project is to predict the price of the car from cardekho.com based on specified parameters

## libraries used are :-


1. Pandas

2. Seaborn

3. Matplotlib.pyplot

4. from sklearn.ensemble -- extra trees regressor and Random Forest Regressor

5. train_test_split

6. Randomised Search CV

7. Metrics

## Approach :- 

-Importing the data set with the help of pandas 

-Performing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on the data set in order to remove unwanted attributes and
 cleaing the data set and preprocessing it for further analysis

-data visualization like creating Pairplot and heatmap for understanding the relationship between various attributes and the collinearity between them

-splitting the data in training data and testing data

-performing predictive analysis using extratreesregressor and randomforestregressor in order to get the model with good accuracy

-finally after visualization checking the errors in model like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Square Error
